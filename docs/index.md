# Overview

*Fierce Planet* is a web programming toolkit for simulating cities and other social systems. 

Designed to work in modern, [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/)-compatible browsers, it can be used to illustrate patterns of urban growth, sustainable development, and the emergence of social networks. It is currently developed by researchers at [RMIT University](http://www.rmit.edu.au) and [University of Western Sydney](http://www.uws.edu.au).

*Fierce Planet* combines several simulation approaches:

 - *Agent-based modelling* - Models use computational agents to represent human and other actors.
 - *Procedural City Building* - City-like structures can be built from interactions between agents and their environment.
 - *Digital Elevation Models* - Publicly-available satellite data can be loaded to provide realistic geographic terrain.
 - *3D rendering* - Models are represented in 3-dimensional space that can be zoomed, panned and rotated.

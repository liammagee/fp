# Interwoven Cities


These are a series of urban fabric models demonstrating aspects of a
forthcoming book on \*Interwoven Cities\*.




Basic Agent Movement
--------------------

In this default model, agents spread across the landscape.
They create modest size dwellings as they go, in a single sprawling settlement.

Separate Settlements
----------------------

In this model, agent develop separate settlements, at a minimum 
distance from each other.
Each settlement is able to develop vertically as well as horizontally,
building a series of cities.

An Interwoven City
------------------

The first "interwoven" model demonstrates the kinds of networks
that develop from a single sprawling metropolis, similar to
*Basic Agent Movement*, but with a resulting form of an urban fabric.

Interwoven Cities
-----------------

The second "interwoven" model demonstrates the connections that 
form between multiple settlements, similar to those established in the 
*Separate Settlements* model. Wandering agents occasionally
develop path lines back to their own buildings, or those of other 
agents in their network. Over a period of time, a more loose but still 
distinctive fabric becomes woven between the various settlement areas.

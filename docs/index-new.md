# Overview

Fierce Planet is an platform for developing agent-based models of cities and other social systems.

It has been developed as a teaching tool. However it can be adapted for other purposes: more sophisticated simulations, games and demonstrations.

Fierce Planet is also highly configurable. The examples show some of the "out-of-the-box" options. It is also possible to add functional hooks to "setup" and "run" actions, to customise agent, terrain, building and road behaviour.

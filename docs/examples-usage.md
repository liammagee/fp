## Basic Configuration {#heading-example-usage-basic}

Shows *Fierce Planet* in its default configuration.

The scene below shows the default configuration of *Fierce Planet*.
Once the scene below has loaded, click on the *Setup* button to populate it with agents. Then click *Run* to begin the simulation.

As the simulation runs, the agents will "build" buildings and roads.
Over time, the buildings will grow and a city scape should emerge.

There are a series of options in the control panel on the right-hand site.
These configure how the simulation develops and appears.

Some changes will happen in real-time, as the simulation runs.
Others will require the simulation to be set up again.

The graph at bottom left shows a few basic statistics:
-   The blue line shows the agent population
-   The red line shows the average health of agent population
-   The green line shows the health of landscape

## Custom - Colorised {#heading-example-usage-colorised}


Demonstrates a stylised color scheme, loosely modelled on the work of
[Remko Heemskerk](http://www.gappenap.com/).

## Grid Streetscape {#heading-example-usage-grid}

Demonstrates a procedural city builder (no agents!).

The model builds a city grid of roads, then adds buildings. It
demonstrates the allocation of buildings without overlapping either
roads or other buildings.

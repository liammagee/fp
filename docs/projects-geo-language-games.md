# Basic Geo Language Game Model

This model has been developed by [Rachel Hendery](http://www.uws.edu.au/staff_profiles/uws_profiles/doctor_rachel_hendery) and [Liam Magee](http://www.uws.edu.au/ics/people/researchers/liam_magee) for a poster presentation, "Geo-Language Games: An Agent-Based Model of the Role of Terrain in Language Diversity", presented at the [2015 Digital Humanities Conference](http://dh2015.org/) in Western Sydney.

# Advanced Linguistic Model

In this model, agents have a richer linguistic model, incorporating:

 - lexicon
 - word order
 - number of phonemes
 - word complexity


These model elements are assigned different weights that signify whether
they are more or less susceptible to modification.
